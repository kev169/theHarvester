This is my modified version well at least it will be, im changing it so
that all of the scans will run when a specific argument is passed, then i
also plan on integrating facebook search and twitter.


Still want to add twitter search, but need to narrow down results. 
Adding GUIbranch to the repo where we'll have gui development in it.
